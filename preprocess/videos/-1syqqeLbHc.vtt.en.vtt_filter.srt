1
00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:15.280
we've got the three v's here of

2
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.440
communications we have the verbal

3
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.240
the verbal is the content of the message

4
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.160
itself they're the words that you're

5
00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:27.359
we have the vocal the vocal is the sound

6
00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.080
the tone the pitch the projection of

7
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.480
your voice what people hear of you

8
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.320
and then finally we have the visual what

9
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.680
people see

10
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.920
of the way that you come across so if

11
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.680
you were to take a look at these

12
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.920
and say well i think what do i think

13
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.680
counts in communicating

14
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.160
so go ahead and in your own mind just

15
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.680
prioritize these

16
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:48.960
what do you think is more heavily

17
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.239
weighted over the others

18
00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:54.160
let's just take a show of hands here how

19
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.280
many people think that

20
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.440
verbal is most or equal importance

21
00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.680
the words that you say most are equal

22
00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.360
got a few hands there all right vocal

23
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.000
most are equal

24
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.600
visual most are equal hey we got a smart

25
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.360
group you're not sleeping that's that's

26
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.320
great

27
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.600
all right well let's take a look at the

28
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.640
numbers and see what they say this is a

29
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.119
classic study done by professor albert

30
00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:24.080
morabian

31
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.840
out of ucla but before i show you those

32
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.040
numbers let me have you do a quick

33
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.240
exercise

34
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.920
make an okay sign with your right hand

35
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.240
everybody do this without hitting your

36
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.720
your neighbor hold it out in front of

37
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:35.360
you

38
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.680
everyone see it out in front of you

39
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.720
above your head

40
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.439
everyone above your head out to the side

41
00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:44.720
and put it on your chin

42
00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:54.079
yeah on your chin let's see

43
00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:55.840
all right they're still gone it's on my

44
00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.680
chin what on your

45
00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.960
chin oh fine uh

46
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.880
yeah oh that's the chin that's my chin

47
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.079
right here what's most important

48
00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:08.319
the visual now let me show you these

49
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.360
but let me first tell you what this does

50
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.440
not mean again this is the classic study

51
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.080
professor albert moravian he wrote a

52
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.720
book called

53
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.640
silent messages the numbers that he

54
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.480
found in his research certainly reflect

55
00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.599
that title take a look

56
00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:27.760
now let me tell you what this does not

57
00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.200
mean

58
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.280
this does not mean that the words you're

59
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.239
saying that the content the meat of your

60
00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:35.360
presentation

61
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.680
only accounts for seven percent of your

62
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.879
experience

63
00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:41.200
what it does mean though is that when

64
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.400
the message

65
00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.560
is inconsistent that is when the words

66
00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.920
that you're saying

67
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.840
don't match what people see or what they

68
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.000
hear

69
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.400
as you're saying it they believe what

70
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.360
they see

71
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.239
over the actual word it's as if i didn't

72
00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:56.959
even say

73
00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.640
chin i had 80 of the audience going this

74
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.200
is my

75
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.680
you've got to have a consistent

76
00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.360
message to engender this trust and

77
00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.280
believability that your listener has

78
00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.920
in you and in your message you have to

79
00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.200
think about getting
