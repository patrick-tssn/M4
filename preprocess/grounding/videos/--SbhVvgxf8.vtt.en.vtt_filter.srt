00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.960
channel in times of uncertainty and

3
00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.480
potential crisis many individuals turn

4
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.120
to prepping as a means of ensuring their

5
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.280
survival and well-being of their loved

6
00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.640
ones while prepping is a personal choice

7
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.680
a way to take control of One's Own

8
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.960
preparedness there have been concerns

9
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.359
about the role of government agencies in

10
00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:24.480
such

11
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.840
scenarios in this video we'll explore

12
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.720
the topic of FEMA the Federal Emergency

13
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.200
Man management agency and the potential

14
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.000
confiscation of prepping items when

15
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.280
shtf it's important to approach this

16
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.960
subject with critical thinking and an

17
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.440
open mind the intention is not to spread

18
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.320
fear or paranoia but to be prepared for

19
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.760
only focusing on prepping here the list

20
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.800
of items we'll discuss is not based on

21
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.160
any official statement from FEMA but it

22
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.680
is a real concern so how concerned

23
00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.079
should we all be FEMA's power to confid

24
00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:01.840
skate

25
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.119
stuff within the United States a

26
00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:06.080
comprehensive collection of executive

27
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.920
orders has been established over the

28
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.320
course of several decades these orders

29
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.240
serve to empower FEMA with extensive

30
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.200
executive Authority in the event of a

31
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.240

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.320
Administration this order provides

53
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.280
specific definitions related to

54
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.280
emergency measures in the context of

55
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.480
this order food resources Encompass a

56
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.920
broad range of Commodities and products

57
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.680
that are suitable for consumption by

58
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.640
humans and animals it includes not only

59
00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.120
basic food items but also substances

60
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.800
such as starches sugars vegetable and

61
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.720
animal fats and oils cotton tobacco wool

mohare hemp flax fiber and Naval storage

63
00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.519
however it's important to know that once

64
00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.319
these materials seiz to be recognized as

65
00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.959
agricultural Commodities or products

66
00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.280
they no longer fall under the scope of

67
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.920
food resources EO 10998 defines farm

68
00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.200
equipment as Machinery equipment and

69
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.920
repair parts primarily intended for use

70
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.720
in agricultural activities associated

71
00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.400
with the production or Preparation of

72
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.519
food

73
00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.440
resources Additionally the order

74
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.800
clarifies that fertilizer refers to any

75
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.000
product or combination of products

76
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.560
specifically designed for plant

77
00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.879
nutrition and distributed to

78
00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:10.200
users lastly food resource facilities

79
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.319
Encompass the infrastructure including

80
00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:14.680
plants Machinery Vehicles including

81
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.959
those used on farms and other related

82
00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.159
facilities involved in the production

83
00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:21.760
processing distribution and storage

84
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.000
including cold storage of food

85
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.560
resources furthermore these facilities

86
00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.720
also handle domestic distribution of

87
00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.519
farm equipment and fertilizer another

88
00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.080
executive order is EO

89
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.400
10995 which provides fima with the

90
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.959
authority to assume control over all

91
00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.120
Communications and media platforms

92
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.200
during

93
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.560
emergencies this includes the ability to

94
00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.959
regulate and direct the dissemination of

95
00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:50.400
information to ensure an organized and

96
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.519
coordinated response to the crisis and

97
00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.959
finally there's executive order

98
00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.360
10997 which grants FEMA the power to

99
00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.599
take control of fuel and various forms

100
00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:03.159
of power this Authority enables FEMA to

101
00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:05.560
coordinate and manage the allocation and

102
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.760
distribution of fuel resources as well

103
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.000
as exercise control over different

104
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.760
energy sources in order to effectively

105
00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.799
address emergency

106
00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:18.239
situations so now that we know that fem

107
00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.799
has the power to confiscate stuff what

108
00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.520
generators generator serve as invaluable

109
00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.759
assets during times of Crisis providing

110
00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:36.280
a source of power when traditional

111
00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.120
electrical infrastructure is compromised

112
00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.039
however it's essential to recognize that

113
00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:43.960
their operation can attract attention

114
00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.800
including that of FEMA particularly in

115
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.360
light of the powers granted to the

116
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.919
agency under EO

117
00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:54.160
10997 as per the executive order FEMA

118
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.400
holds Federal authority to requisition

119
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.240
various forms of fuel and power

120
00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.080
necessary to fulfill their their mission

121
00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.680
in emergency

122
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.120
situations this encompassing power

123
00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.720
extends to generators which FEMA could

124
00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.639
potentially identify based on their

125
00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:11.479
noise or other detection methods even

126
00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:14.240
from a significant distance during

127
00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.680
disasters FEMA is known to establish

128
00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.160
camps to accommodate affected

129
00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.520
individuals and facilitate response

130
00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.080
operations it is conceivable that these

131
00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.520
camps may require a reliable power

132
00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.039
supply for various purposes such as

133
00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:29.960
providing energy for critical

134
00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.360
infrastructure medical facilities and

135
00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.400
communication systems consequently thema

136
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.360
May exercise their authority to Seas

137
00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.800
power sources including generators to

138
00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.080
fulfill these

139
00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.240
needs

140
00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.360
fuel in times of Crisis the availability

141
00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.639
of fuel becomes a crucial factor in

142
00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:52.840
determining one's ability to navigate

143
00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.199
and respond effectively whether it's

144
00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:57.520
gasoline diesel or other types of fuel

145
00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.039
its significance can not be overstated

146
00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:02.919
when a disaster strikes and you bring

147
00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:05.680
fuel into an affected area it becomes a

148
00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.479
finite resource upon which you rely

149
00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:10.599
power's essential equipment vehicles and

150
00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:12.840
generators enabling you to sustain

151
00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.560
yourself and meet your basic needs

152
00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.120
however once your fuel reserves are

153
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.400
depleted you are left with limited

154
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.080
options either Evacuate the area or

155
00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.520
search for additional fuel sources

156
00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.199
during such circumstances FEMA empowered

157
00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:29.680
by various executive orders May May

158
00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.080
develop an interest in your fuel

159
00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.199
stockpile given their Authority they

160
00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:36.520
possess the ability to requisition fuel

161
00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.319
to support their operations particularly

162
00:06:39.319 --> 00:06:41.479
when it comes to fueling their vehicles

163
00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:43.199
providing energy for critical

164
00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:45.280
infrastructure and facilitating

165
00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.160
emergency response efforts this means

166
00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.840
that your fuel reserves painstakingly

167
00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.639
accumulated for emergency situations

168
00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:56.840
could potentially be subject to

169
00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.400
confiscation

170
00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.120
weapons

171
00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.160
while there are limited precedents for

172
00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.000
such actions instances of weapons being

173
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.080
seized have occurred in specific

174
00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.319
circumstances such as in New Orleans

175
00:07:09.319 --> 00:07:11.800
after Hurricane Katrina and in Boston

176
00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.240
following the Marathon bombing these

177
00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.800
incidences have raise concerns and Spark

178
00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.599
debates about the balance between

179
00:07:18.599 --> 00:07:21.039
individual rights and Public Safety in

180
00:07:21.039 --> 00:07:23.560
the event of a major crisis FEMA as a

181
00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.720
federal agency task with emergency

182
00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.520
response may face the challenging task

183
00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.879
of maintaining order and ensuring Public

184
00:07:30.879 --> 00:07:33.879
Safety it's possible that they may seek

185
00:07:33.879 --> 00:07:36.000
to disarm individuals and collect

186
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.319
Firearms aiming to prevent potential

187
00:07:38.319 --> 00:07:40.599
misuse or acts of violence during the

188
00:07:40.599 --> 00:07:43.960
emergency response and Recovery phase

189
00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:45.680
the issue becomes complex when

190
00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.720
considering constitutional rights

191
00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:50.080
particularly the protections provided by

192
00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:52.360
the Second Amendment but in the face of

193
00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.919
an emergency FEMA might argue that the

194
00:07:54.919 --> 00:07:57.280
temporary suspension or restriction of

195
00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.039
certain rights including the Second

196
00:07:59.039 --> 00:08:00.120
Amendment

197
00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.199
is necessary for the greater public good

198
00:08:02.199 --> 00:08:04.440
and the effective management of the

199
00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:07.919
crisis radios and communication

200
00:08:07.919 --> 00:08:11.240
devices as previously established FEMA

201
00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.319
has legal backing for confiscating

202
00:08:13.319 --> 00:08:15.440
communication devices the

203
00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:17.879
conspicuousness of a large antenna on

204
00:08:17.879 --> 00:08:20.960
your truck May attract FEMA's attention

205
00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:22.879
the magnitude of the disaster often

206
00:08:22.879 --> 00:08:25.240
correlates with FEMA's increased need or

207
00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.639
desire for additional resources they

208
00:08:27.639 --> 00:08:29.280
would highly value reliable

209
00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:31.599
communication tools like Bal Fang radios

210
00:08:31.599 --> 00:08:34.120
or powerful ham systems to augment their

211
00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.880
communication operations considering the

212
00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.279
potential confiscation of such items it

213
00:08:39.279 --> 00:08:41.440
becomes pertinent to review the storage

214
00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:44.200
methods for ham radios and evaluate

215
00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.160
whether it's necessary to adopt more

216
00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.279
covert means of utilizing and

217
00:08:48.279 --> 00:08:49.519
safeguarding

218
00:08:49.519 --> 00:08:52.640
them medical

219
00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.120
supplies FEMA will take measures to

220
00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.640
procure medical equipment and medicines

221
00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:00.079
confiscating items they deem essential

222
00:09:00.079 --> 00:09:02.760
from your medical stockpiles medical

223
00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.720
supplies are even more vulnerable than

224
00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:07.440
food because if FEMA determines you to

225
00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.480
be healthy they may consider your

226
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.800
medical preps unnecessary and seize them

227
00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.600
well they must leave you some food to

228
00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.200
sustain yourself they may approach

229
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.360
medical supplies

230
00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:20.519
differently

231
00:09:20.519 --> 00:09:23.320
food as mentioned earlier fuma possesses

232
00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.800
the authority and intent to not only

233
00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.320
take away food but also take control of

234
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:31.200
farms once they acquire food resources

235
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.760
they determine how the distribution will

236
00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:36.800
occur imagining all your store food

237
00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.920
being taken away in an emergency is

238
00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:43.160
distressing particularly after years of

239
00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.839
preparation people who are unconcerned

240
00:09:45.839 --> 00:09:47.920
about you and your family may be the

241
00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.640
ones taking your Provisions thus it

242
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.560
becomes crucial to maximize the

243
00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:56.120
utilization of multiple hidden storage

244
00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:58.800
locations if our genuine intention is to

245
00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.040
help during a crisis we may need to

246
00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:04.120
relinquish a portion of our visible food

247
00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.360
storage to FEMA while secretly

248
00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.560
preserving the majority of our stockpile

249
00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.480
in hidden

250
00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:13.000
locations bottled

251
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.880
water water is an indispensable resource

252
00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:18.240
in any disastrous scenario having a

253
00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.440
sufficient supply of bottled water is

254
00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:22.800
critical it's recommended to store at

255
00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.640
least one gallon of water per person per

256
00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:29.360
day for a minimum of 3 days counting for

257
00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.760
both drinking and sanitation

258
00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.200
needs additionally understanding water

259
00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:37.200
filtration methods is crucial in some

260
00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.040
situations stored water may become

261
00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.240
depleted requiring the utilization of

262
00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.800
alternative water sources learning about

263
00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.839
various filtration techniques such as

264
00:10:45.839 --> 00:10:48.560
using water filters or purification

265
00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.680
tablets can help ensure the safety of

266
00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:52.839
water collected from natural sources

267
00:10:52.839 --> 00:10:54.920
like rainfall rivers or

268
00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.560
lakes it's essential to familiarize

269
00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:59.399
yourself with proper filtration

270
00:10:59.399 --> 00:11:01.800
procedures to minimize the risk of

271
00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:02.959
waterborne

272
00:11:02.959 --> 00:11:05.120
illnesses during a disaster

273
00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.560
contamination of local water sources is

274
00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:10.440
a common occurrence Public Water Systems

275
00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.800
may become compromised making the water

276
00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.440
in your home the only viable option for

277
00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:18.040
consumption in such situations the

278
00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.800
availability of your stored water

279
00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:21.639
becomes

280
00:11:21.639 --> 00:11:23.680
invaluable however it's important to

281
00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:26.240
recognize that FEMA May seize your water

282
00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:29.079
Reserve so keep a portion hidden to

283
00:11:29.079 --> 00:11:31.079
ensure your family's needs are met as

284
00:11:31.079 --> 00:11:33.000
standing in line for a bottle of water

285
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.480
from your own pre purchase case can be

286
00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:40.600
infuriating the void left by the absence

287
00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.480
of civil defense civil defense in the

288
00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:45.480
United States was a comprehensive

289
00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.560
preparedness plan that was designed by

290
00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:50.519
and for the people it served as a

291
00:11:50.519 --> 00:11:52.680
brilliant framework to ensure the safety

292
00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:54.800
and wellbe of the nation however with

293
00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:57.120
the end of the Cold War American Civil

294
00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:59.639
Defense gradually faded into obscurity

295
00:11:59.639 --> 00:12:01.920
leading to a shift in Focus towards a

296
00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:04.360
sense of Perpetual security and

297
00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:07.279
prosperity solely relyant on a country's

298
00:12:07.279 --> 00:12:10.200
formidable military capabilities

299
00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.000
unfortunately the absence of civil

300
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.639
defense is left a void that's been

301
00:12:13.639 --> 00:12:16.199
filled with various responses including

302
00:12:16.199 --> 00:12:18.920
individual prepping panic and divisive

303
00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:20.560
blame within our

304
00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:23.279
nation in the absence of a centralized

305
00:12:23.279 --> 00:12:25.720
civil defense system agencies such as

306
00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:29.120
FEMA and DHS have emerged to ass assum

307
00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:32.279
the responsibility of keeping us safe

308
00:12:32.279 --> 00:12:34.639
from both perceived and actual threats

309
00:12:34.639 --> 00:12:36.480
including the Spectre of natural

310
00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:39.519
disasters and the notion of unseen

311
00:12:39.519 --> 00:12:42.800
enemies the significant powers vested in

312
00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.839
FEMA are a consequence of our Collective

313
00:12:45.839 --> 00:12:48.680
abdication of responsibility as American

314
00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:51.480
citizens in our pursuit of immediate

315
00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:54.519
gratification and complacency we've

316
00:12:54.519 --> 00:12:56.720
prioritized entertainment and Leisure

317
00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:59.040
over the imperative of preparedness for

318
00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:02.199
future disasters consequently FEMA and

319
00:13:02.199 --> 00:13:04.639
other emergency response agencies have

320
00:13:04.639 --> 00:13:07.000
been burdened with the arduous task of

321
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.519
compensating for our lack of Readiness

322
00:13:09.519 --> 00:13:11.519
based on personal experiences and

323
00:13:11.519 --> 00:13:13.639
insights shared by fellow Preppers who

324
00:13:13.639 --> 00:13:16.399
have interacted with FEMA it's evident

325
00:13:16.399 --> 00:13:19.079
that the agency's effectiveness is often

326
00:13:19.079 --> 00:13:21.560
questioned while FEMA plays a critical

327
00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:24.279
role in Disaster Response it can never

328
00:13:24.279 --> 00:13:26.240
match the effectiveness of prepared

329
00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:28.240
communities and neighboring communities

330
00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.519
that rally together in times of Crisis

331
00:13:31.519 --> 00:13:33.440
