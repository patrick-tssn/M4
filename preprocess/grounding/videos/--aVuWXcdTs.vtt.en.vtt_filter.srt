00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.519
hi again Mark here from talkingbass.net

3
00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:11.400
this lesson I'll be covering one of the

4
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.200
most basic parts of Music Theory and

5
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.360
bass plane the topic of intervals and

6
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.600
the major scale so what are intervals

7
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.640
well an interval is a measurement or

8
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.599
unit of musical distance just as meters

9
00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:26.480
centimeters miles feet yards and inches

10
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.640
are all measures of physical distance

11
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.400
the smallest unit we use in general

12
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.239
western music is the semitone and that's

13
00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.200
really easy to see on a bass guitar neck

14
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.320
because it's just one Frets worth of

15
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.360
distance so if we're on a c third fret

16
00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.000
on the a string and we move up one fret

17
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.600
to a c Shar that's one semitone of

18
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.199
distance so C to C Shar is a semitone if

19
00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:51.360
we want to move up a tone that's two

20
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.359
semitones of distance that'll be two

21
00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:57.600
Frets of distance so C to D that's a

22
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.920
turn we can move up and down these two

23
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.119
two so C down to b a fret that's a semi-

24
00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:08.360
tone C down to B flat that's a tone and

25
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.799
it doesn't matter where you play these

26
00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:12.400
or what note the principle still applies

27
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.680
so D to a d Shar is a semit tone D to e

28
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.600
is a tone G Shar to a is a semitone G

29
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.720
Shar to a Shar is a tone and so on now

30
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.439
turns and semi- turns are great for

31
00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:28.720
describing and measuring small units of

32
00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.119
distance but to describe something much

33
00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.439
larger like let's say a g up to a high V

34
00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.960
flat uh would become much much more

35
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.439
difficult in terms of tones and semmit

36
00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:40.799
tones we'd be looking at 20 or more

37
00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.399
semmit tones of distance and it's much

38
00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:45.719
harder to measure and keep track of uh

39
00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:48.280
you wouldn't use centimeters or inches

40
00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.159
to measure a large physical distance

41
00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.119
you'd be more likely to use miles or

42
00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:55.280
kilometers so we need another set of

43
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.399
terms to describe these larger musical

44
00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:59.399
distances and that's where the major

45
00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.520
scale comes in major scales are built up

46
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.360
from a formula of tones and semmit tones

47
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.960
uh and that formula is uh tone tone

48
00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.000
semmit tone tone tone tone semmit tone

49
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.319
so two tones and a semmit tone and then

50
00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.640
three tones and a semmit tone uh that

51
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.760
might sound a little confusing but it'll

52
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.599
make more sense when you see it on the

53
00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:23.000
neck so if we take a c at the third fret

54
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.920
on the a string and then move up a tone

55
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.200
to the D then up a tone to the E then up

56
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.760
a semitone to the F that's the first

57
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.040
part turnone turnone semi tone then we

58
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.640
continue up to the G upper tone up

59
00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.319
another tone to the a up another tone to

60
00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.800
the B and then finally up a semitone to

61
00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.080
the C that's the whole formula tone tone

62
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.920
semmit tone tone tone tone semit tone so

63
00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.920
that gives us all these notes c d e f g

64
00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.800
a b c and that's the c major scale now

65
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.640
it's all well and good no in the scale

66
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.040
on one string but to be of more use to

67
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.040
us we really need to learn these notes

68
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.599
across the strings so if we start on the

69
00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:11.519
C third fret on the a string with the

70
00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.280
second finger and work across we end it

71
00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.040
with the c then D fifth fret on the a

72
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.840
string with the fourth finger e second

73
00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.560
fret on the D string with the first

74
00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.599
finger F third fret on the D string with

75
00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:28.400
the second finger G fifth fret on the D

76
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.200
string with the fourth finger

77
00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.200
a second fret on the G string with the

78
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.000
first finger B fourth fret on the G

79
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.720
string with the third finger and finally

80
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.799
C fifth fret on the G string with the

81
00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:47.040
pattern you want to learn it both up and

82
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.080
down uh and make sure you memorize the

83
00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.799
pattern really well because uh this is

84
00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:53.079
going to be used over and over and over

85
00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:00.400
playing okay

86
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.599
now the good thing about a bass or a

87
00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:04.920
guitar or any threed instrument is that

88
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.319
these fingering patterns that we're

89
00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:08.879
learning are actually movable now this

90
00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:10.560
is a bit of a shortcut and other

91
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.079
instrumentalists might find this a

92
00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:13.959
little bit of a cheat uh in that you

93
00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:15.799
don't have to learn the individual notes

94
00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:18.519
for a particular scale on a piano for

95
00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.280
instance you'd have to learn each scale

96
00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.560
by its palet of pitch names and its

97
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.280
combination of white and black keys or

98
00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.160
accidentals uh so you'd have to know

99
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.160
that there for instance there's an F in

100
00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.240
a g major scale Etc on a guitar or a Bas

101
00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.240
you don't really need to do that of

102
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.840
course you're going to need to learn all

103
00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.199
that stuff eventually anyway uh but to

104
00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:40.680
begin with uh you can just just to help

105
00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.880
with the learning process uh it's worth

106
00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.080
learning these patterns so if we look at

107
00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.520
the fingering pattern that we've used

108
00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.479
for this major scale and have a look at

109
00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:50.600
how we've assigned a certain finger for

110
00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.759
each fret we'll find that the first

111
00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:55.960
finger is taking the second fret second

112
00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.240
finger is taking the third fret third

113
00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.840
finger is taking the fourth fret and the

114
00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.560
fourth finger is taking the fifth fret

115
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.680
on each string now if we take that

116
00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.840
fingering pattern and we just move it up

117
00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.840
a turn so that the second finger is now

118
00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.240
on the d uh and then we move that exact

119
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.600
same fingering pattern that we used for

120
00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.360
the c major of second finger fourth

121
00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.560
finger first finger second finger fourth

122
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.400
finger first finger third finger fourth

123
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.199
finger that's the D major scale you can

124
00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:23.800
move it wherever you want to uh to start

125
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.039
so let's start on a

126
00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:31.600
g that's the G Major scale an a it's the

127
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:37.560
a major scale C Shar C major scale gsh

128
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.720
t- major scale wherever you want to play

129
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.639
it that pattern and combination of tones

130
00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:44.639
and semi- tones is a major scale so

131
00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:46.600
practice that around the neck starting

132
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.560
on different notes and then you'll be

133
00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.120
ready to move on to the intervals that

134
00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.319
are within the major scale so to learn

135
00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:54.280
these intervals first we need to number

136
00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.400
the notes of the major scale so if we

137
00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.240
use the same C major scale as an example

138
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.039
and we number the notes we get the

139
00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:05.720
following first second third fourth

140
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.199
fifth 6th 7eventh and we're back to the

141
00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:11.560
octave and can repeat the pattern again

142
00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.240
these numbers are actually referred to

143
00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.720
as scale degrees so we can use them to

144
00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.000
describe Melodies and baselines with

145
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.120
reference to which notes of the scale or

146
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.560
key are being used so if we go through

147
00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.759
them again C is the first degree of the

148
00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:28.039
c major scale uh it's also called the

149
00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:30.319
tonic or root note because it's the home

150
00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:32.400
and starting note that we use to label

151
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.520
the scale D the second degree e the

152
00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.520
third f is the fourth degree G is the

153
00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.639
fifth degree a is the 6th degree B is

154
00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:45.160
the 7th degree and C is back to the

155
00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.680
tonic so you can see that the major

156
00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.680
scale is actually classed as a seven

157
00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.080
note scale even though when we play up

158
00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.800
and down there seem to be eight notes

159
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.280
because we include the octave when we

160
00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.319
get to the

161
00:06:56.319 --> 00:06:59.800
top so these scale degrees are the basic

162
00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.639
for naming and describing musical

163
00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:03.560
intervals and there's a difference

164
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.759
between scale degrees and intervals and

165
00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:07.360
that'll become more apparent once we've

166
00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.319
covered the actual interval names but

167
00:07:09.319 --> 00:07:13.000
for now just go with it so the intervals

168
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.800
within a major scale use the same

169
00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.919
numbering system but we add an extra

170
00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:19.120
name to them uh and that can be more

171
00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.240
simply described as the first the fourth

172
00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:25.000
and the fifth are all perfect and all

173
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.520
the other are major in a major scale so

174
00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.520
the first is actually referred to as the

175
00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.960
Unison which sounds a little bit weird

176
00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.360
as we're only playing one note at a time

177
00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.840
uh but that just comes from the fact

178
00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.160
that the study of Harmony uh generally

179
00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.039
deals with polyphonic music so if we

180
00:07:42.039 --> 00:07:43.879
play the major scale again with all the

181
00:07:43.879 --> 00:07:45.800
interval names we end up with the

182
00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.599
following perfect Unison major 2 major

183
00:07:49.599 --> 00:07:53.080
3D perfect fourth perfect fifth major

184
00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:56.400
6th major 7th and the perfect

185
00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.680
octave now we know the intervals within

186
00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.319
the major scale scale we can start to

187
00:08:00.319 --> 00:08:02.520
look at them away from a specific scale

188
00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.280
or key and more as a measuring stick for

189
00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.400
any distance anywhere on the neck at any

190
00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.840
time now to do this we need to learn

191
00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:12.919
them all as separate individual patterns

192
00:08:12.919 --> 00:08:15.000
and when you do this you'll start seeing

193
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.680
how everything that we play on bass is

194
00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.599
made up of combinations of these

195
00:08:18.599 --> 00:08:21.080
patterns uh this approach to viewing all

196
00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.639
the music that you play will have a

197
00:08:22.639 --> 00:08:24.560
profound effect on the speed at which

198
00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.120
you learn and it'll form the basis for

199
00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:28.680
pretty much everything that you'll learn

200
00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:31.159
from B basic baselines to Advanced music

201
00:08:31.159 --> 00:08:33.640
theory and I really can't overstate the

202
00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.959
usefulness and importance of knowing and

203
00:08:35.959 --> 00:08:39.159
recognizing these intervals all the time

204
00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:41.279
so a straightforward exercise that we

205
00:08:41.279 --> 00:08:43.039
can use to go about memorizing these

206
00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:45.320
intervals is to Simply take a certain

207
00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:47.720
interval and just play it on every fret

208
00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.320
from a c up to the 12th fret and back

209
00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:53.360
again so let's take the major third as

210
00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.440
an example if we play a major third

211
00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.839
pattern on the C the third uh fret on

212
00:08:57.839 --> 00:09:00.640
the a string we have the C and then

213
00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.320
we've got the E on the second fret on

214
00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:04.360
the D string and you'll be able to see

215
00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.760
that this pattern's like a little

216
00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.240
diagonal pattern that moves uper upper

217
00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.640
string and down a fret and if we take

218
00:09:16.519 --> 00:09:19.120
time to the 12th

219
00:09:23.279 --> 00:09:26.040
down that's the exercise and we can

220
00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.399
apply that to all the other intervals so

221
00:09:28.399 --> 00:09:29.680
if we take

222
00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:48.800
fourth perfect

223
00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:52.200
fifth major

224
00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:59.720
7th Etc as you do this the individual

225
00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:01.399
look of each interval will start to

226
00:10:01.399 --> 00:10:03.320
stand out a little more and you'll begin

227
00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:04.920
to get used to how they're both

228
00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:07.120
different and similar to each other uh

229
00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.360
for instance the major 3D looks a little

230
00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:11.800
bit like a major sixth because they both

231
00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.560
drop down a fret just on different

232
00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.399
strings uh the perfect fifth and the

233
00:10:16.399 --> 00:10:18.480
octave are similar in that exact same

234
00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.440
way same fret different string the major

235
00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.560
sth that stands out because it's a

236
00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.440
little bit different to all the others

237
00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.120
uh in just moving up a fret the perfect

238
00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:30.640
fourth that's got its own look of a

239
00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:33.160
barring across the two strings and each

240
00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.079
interval needs to be seen to have its

241
00:10:35.079 --> 00:10:37.720
own characteristic look and sound you

242
00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.200
want to listen to the sound of each

243
00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.079
interval uh and I'll be covering this

244
00:10:41.079 --> 00:10:43.519
oral recognition of the intervals in

245
00:10:43.519 --> 00:10:45.760
another lesson but for now just try to

246
00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.360
accept the sounds you hear from each

247
00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.680
interval and uh try to hear them before

248
00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:52.920
you play them uh the major second sounds

249
00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.040
like the start of a major scale uh

250
00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:57.360
because it is uh the perfect fifth is

251
00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.639
used in thousands of baselines and

252
00:10:59.639 --> 00:11:01.639
that's probably the most useful interval

253
00:11:01.639 --> 00:11:04.079
that you'll that you'll learn aside from

254
00:11:04.079 --> 00:11:05.800
the octave and the

255
00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:08.200
Unison and but for now you just need to

256
00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.680
concentrate on getting these interval

257
00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.880
patterns under your fingers uh and don't

258
00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.360
worry about doing too much too soon uh

259
00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:15.920
just try to recognize that there's a

260
00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.920
difference to the sound of each of the

261
00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:20.120
intervals as you start playing them and

262
00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:22.240
just pay attention to it now if we get

263
00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.120
back to the measuring side of intervals

264
00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.079
as we did with semitones and tones at

265
00:11:26.079 --> 00:11:28.079
the beginning of the lesson uh we can

266
00:11:28.079 --> 00:11:29.839
start to see how these new interval

267
00:11:29.839 --> 00:11:32.440
labels can help in describing larger uh

268
00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:35.720
distances so if we take a g on the E

269
00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:37.680
string the third fret and we want to

270
00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:40.120
measure a perfect fifth from it we just

271
00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.800
use the perfect fifth interval that

272
00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.320
we've learned and we can see that a

273
00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:47.200
perfect fifth from G is D so D is a

274
00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:50.839
perfect fifth from G okay and now if we

275
00:11:50.839 --> 00:11:53.800
take a d on the a string and we see some

276
00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:56.360
pattern involving a c Shar above it we

277
00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:58.240
now know from the intervals that we've

278
00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.600
learned that that's a major 7th patter

279
00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:04.720
and that c Shar is a major 7th from D

280
00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.920
okay as you learn these interval

281
00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:08.639
patterns by heart you should start to

282
00:12:08.639 --> 00:12:10.600
see these patterns automatically and it

283
00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.240
shouldn't be a process of figuring them

284
00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:15.040
out at all uh all the Melodies and Bas

285
00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:16.880
lines that you'll play will start to

286
00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:18.760
appear to you as combinations of these

287
00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:20.920
intervals which in turn could be really

288
00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:22.880
helpful in learning and memorizing

289
00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:25.480
things it's much easier to learn

290
00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.880
something when you know that it's just a

291
00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.480
succession of building blocks that

292
00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:31.000
you've already learned uh as opposed to

293
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.839
a long string of unrelated notes uh that

294
00:12:33.839 --> 00:12:36.079
can turn into a memory feet just like

295
00:12:36.079 --> 00:12:39.079
learning pi to 200 decimal places Now

296
00:12:39.079 --> 00:12:41.160
One Last Thing Before I finish uh this

297
00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.120
first discussion on intervals and that's

298
00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:45.000
the difference between a melodic and a

299
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.040
harmonic interval uh this is a really

300
00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:49.320
simple concept so don't worry A melodic

301
00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:51.639
interval is an interval played one note

302
00:12:51.639 --> 00:12:53.480
at a time just as we've been doing

303
00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:55.959
throughout the lesson so a harmonic

304
00:12:55.959 --> 00:12:58.040
interval is an interval where both notes

305
00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.560
are played at the same same time like a

306
00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:02.240
chord when you think of a harmonic it

307
00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.839
cones up images of you know harmonics or

308
00:13:04.839 --> 00:13:06.800
overtones of a string that's not what

309
00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:08.920
this means it's simply the two notes of

310
00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:11.160
an interval played together in harmony

311
00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.079
so if we take G to a d there perfect

312
00:13:14.079 --> 00:13:17.160
fifth played together it's a harmonic

313
00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.839
interval played separately it's a

314
00:13:19.839 --> 00:13:22.279
melodic interval okay so that's the

315
00:13:22.279 --> 00:13:24.639
intervals within the major scale uh stay

316
00:13:24.639 --> 00:13:26.440
tuned for my next video Lesson when I'll

317
00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:28.320
be covering all the other intervals uh

318
00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:30.399
we use in music that's the minor

319
00:13:30.399 --> 00:13:32.360
intervals the augmented uh and

320
00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:34.199
diminished intervals uh and I'll be

321
00:13:34.199 --> 00:13:35.959
clearing up a few Theory terms that

322
00:13:35.959 --> 00:13:37.720
might confuse you that relate to this
