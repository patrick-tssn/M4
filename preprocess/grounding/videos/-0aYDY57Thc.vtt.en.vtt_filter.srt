1
00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.199
my daughter husband and I have been

2
00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:03.439
living in this adorable Tri level for

3
00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:07.000
about 7 years now in Virginia and I will

4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.639
say that I started out foring this house

5
00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:12.440
as much as possible trying to fill it as

6
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.280
quickly as I could but over the past

7
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.480
four or five years now I have been very

8
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.760
intentionally decluttering it and we are

9
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.080
where we are now I thought we'd do a fun

10
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.480
tour starting right in my living room

11
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.279
talking about what I do own and

12
00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:32.320
hopefully giving you some ideas on how

13
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.120
you can declutter your own what I really

14
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.160
wanted in my living room was to have a

15
00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.280
space that felt easy to clean but also

16
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.840
just open and fresh and beautiful so I

17
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.440
love to bring in plants and I have

18
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.480
several around my house that are my

19
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.079
favorites but I also really like the

20
00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.719
look of wood so while our hardwood

21
00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.160
floors are beautiful in their own I also

22
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.559
wanted to add these wooden shelves which

23
00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:58.480
I know we all have our opinions on them

24
00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.960
but I really like them the way they are

25
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.239
one of my favorite things about this

26
00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:03.879
living room is this behind the couch

27
00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:06.119
table not only did my husband make it

28
00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.720
himself and so it's exactly what I

29
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.880
wanted Dimension wise but also what I

30
00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.720
found is that when it comes to Furniture

31
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.000
pieces the only ones that I bring in now

32
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.640
pieces that I think are functional but

33
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.080
also beautiful the couch that my grandma

34
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.040
gifted me for my birthday a couple years

35
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.799
ago is just what I wanted it's high up

36
00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:26.159
off the ground and so it's easy to clean

37
00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.040
under the other great thing about this

38
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.479
room are the big bay windows we are so

39
00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.520
lucky to have these massive windows that

40
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.000
bring in tons of natural light so I

41
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.680
never wanted to cover them up with

42
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.759
really heavy curtains when I walk right

43
00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.200
in the door I knew that we needed

44
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.880
function so I made sure to put a

45
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.119
keychain holder that also has a place

46
00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.360
that we can put our excess mail and then

47
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.320
on the little shelf that is right near

48
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.399
our door I also put a bowl to throw in

49
00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:53.759
things like sunglasses and my headphones

50
00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.039
while you're going through your entryway

51
00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:58.280
make sure that you have enough places

52
00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.200
for your clutter so things like my

53
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.159
daughter's book bag and my purse I

54
00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.119
wanted to be obvious where to put them

55
00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.560
and easy to access no home feels

56
00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.000
complete to me unless you have a

57
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.840
decluttering basket and that's exactly

58
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.120
what this small basket is right near our

59
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.280
door and as you can see it already has a

60
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.160
bag that's ready to go as we turn and go

61
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.519
into my dining room it's pretty dramatic

62
00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:25.440
I painted it this color back years ago

63
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.720
when we first moved in and I still

64
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.239
really like it on the walls I have a few

65
00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.440
of my favorite pieces one of them is

66
00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.160
from my grandfather before he passed

67
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.200
away and the other one is this beautiful

68
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.280
Sunburst mirror we are looking for some

69
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.000
new chairs to go in our dining room

70
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.120
because the ones we have were found on

71
00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.400
the side of the road and they are not

72
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.280
holding up well but they were free so I

73
00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.360
guess we can't complain as you turn into

74
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.159
our kitchen I would love for this

75
00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:54.599
kitchen to be open floor plan right into

76
00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.480
the living room but it's one of those

77
00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.239
things that it would cost a lot of money

78
00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.120
and a lot of hassle so we just Haven got

79
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.560
into it yet but the countertops and the

80
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.560
sink have been replaced and I love our

81
00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.560
new cook top that's just extremely

82
00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.680
simple for us to clean with a little

83
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.879
soap and water though I don't love our

84
00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:14.200
black refrigerator it is so easy to keep

85
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.040
clean and you don't constantly have to

86
00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.360
see fingerprints the kitchen is pretty

87
00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.080
simple we unfortunately don't have any

88
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.360
kind of pantry and so the little

89
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.799
cabinets on the side do hold all of our

90
00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:27.239
food which which in turn actually is

91
00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:28.959
probably helpful because there is no

92
00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.680
place for our food to go hide and we

93
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.120
forget to eat it everything is right

94
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.599
there in the open in these little

95
00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:38.040
baskets that I've put and labeled so

96
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.799
it's easy to know when we need to go to

97
00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:41.760
the grocery store again before we leave

98
00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.959
this floor I wanted to show you my

99
00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.680
entryway closet now there's not a lot of

100
00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.159
Pizzaz going on in this closet it's

101
00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:49.799
extremely functional there's a little

102
00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.439
bench that we can sit on to put our

103
00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:54.360
shoes on when necessary and underneath

104
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.840
the bench I have three small shoe

105
00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.920
containers one for me one for my

106
00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.680
daughter and one for my husband I love

107
00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.000
these containers cuz they're so easy to

108
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.519
clean and they're actually the perfect

109
00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:05.879
size Keeps Us in check and so we're not

110
00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:08.840
just over buying shoes just because and

111
00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.560
then my husband took out the rod that

112
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.720
had hangers because the hangers just got

113
00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.640
very frustrating trying to keep our

114
00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.600
coats on them and not have them fall off

115
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.120
so instead we opted for some hooks that

116
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.320
I think are very beautiful but also

117
00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.560
extremely functional again then looking

118
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.440
up we have two more baskets one of them

119
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.680
holds most of the things for our outdoor

120
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.720
activities we also have a few games we

121
00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.880
keep in here for easy access and then

122
00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.639
the other basket is great for just our

123
00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:36.759
hats and gloves let's go ahead and

124
00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:39.240
travel downstairs as you can see it's

125
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.240
basically just one big sitting room that

126
00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.440
we also use as our office our office is

127
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.440
usually semi cluttered throughout the

128
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.919
day just from me working at it all day

129
00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:51.440
and my husband at night have a TV down

130
00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.960
here this is where we'll do movie nights

131
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.840
or game nights and then onto the side we

132
00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.320
have a small bathroom that my husband

133
00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.039
couple years ago updated which is

134
00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:03.840
beautiful town here used to be a really

135
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.720
ugly Brown bathroom that was just all

136
00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.560
different shades of brown so I'm so

137
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.440
grateful that he was able to get this

138
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.680
done and then finally on the side you

139
00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.800
can see this is just a utility room my

140
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.120
husband's tools are often in here and

141
00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.280
then things like the laundry also are

142
00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.120
down here I will say the best thing we

143
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.960
put in this laundry room is just this

144
00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.919
very simple shelf it's amazing what

145
00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:28.120
having a little bit of storage does in a

146
00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.960
space that used to feel so cluttered as

147
00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.039
we head back up the stairs you'll see

148
00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:35.280
that our top floor we have three

149
00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.280
bedrooms and one more bathroom this

150
00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.039
bathroom is obviously dated and it is

151
00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:43.400
from the 1960s but I actually really

152
00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.280
like the tile it is this happy blue

153
00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.520
turquoisey kind of color so we haven't

154
00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.000
done anything with it but the bathtub

155
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.800
and the sink I would love to replace at

156
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.039
some point down the road because this

157
00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:57.199
bathroom and the closet that's attached

158
00:05:57.199 --> 00:05:59.639
to it is pretty small we need to keep

159
00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:01.759
keep things very simple so in the

160
00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:04.400
bathroom closet I have several different

161
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.880
homes that I keep for things like

162
00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:09.120
medicine and our towels and rags and

163
00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.199
while I used to feel like every linen

164
00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:13.240
closet had to be full to the brim in

165
00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.759
order to be a well-run house I have

166
00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:18.560
found that having a few rags and one

167
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.160
towel each a few extra just for my

168
00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.639
daughter and the dogs is all I really

169
00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:25.919
need we don't have a medicine cabinet up

170
00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:27.840
here so instead we do have another

171
00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.639
little white container that we use as

172
00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:32.440
has our medicine cabinet and it works

173
00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.960
great inside of the basket what I will

174
00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.720
say to do is get a bigger basket and

175
00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.599
then get smaller baskets inside to hold

176
00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:40.800
your smaller stuff so everything isn't

177
00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.000
just roaming around all the time it's

178
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.319
like you're creating a drawer even

179
00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:46.120
though you don't have one if you go

180
00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.919
right under our sink you'll see that we

181
00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:49.680
have some more storage down there where

182
00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.759
is basically I just keep our cleaning

183
00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:55.560
supplies and our small trash can so that

184
00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.759
the dogs don't get into it and then just

185
00:06:57.759 --> 00:07:00.759
a few extra things like perfume and

186
00:07:00.759 --> 00:07:03.080
lotions that we use throughout the week

187
00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.080
in the two drawers on the side one of

188
00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.879
them is dedicated for my stuff like my

189
00:07:07.879 --> 00:07:10.639
makeup but also our toothbrushes we put

190
00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:12.599
them inside of the drawer just so that

191
00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:15.360
the countertop can stay very visually

192
00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.280
clear and then the other drawer is

193
00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:19.479
dedicated just for my husband's

194
00:07:19.479 --> 00:07:21.720
stuff then if we head back out you'll

195
00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.639
see my daughter's room is the first one

196
00:07:23.639 --> 00:07:26.199
we come to because my brother recently

197
00:07:26.199 --> 00:07:28.319
moved out we were able to take all of

198
00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:30.240
her toys back out of her room room and I

199
00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.479
will show you where we put them now but

200
00:07:32.479 --> 00:07:34.759
in her room it's very simple we have a

201
00:07:34.759 --> 00:07:36.879
few pieces of artwork up that she's done

202
00:07:36.879 --> 00:07:39.560
or my nieces have done and then we have

203
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:42.080
some simple shelves for books and then

204
00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.680
in her closet we will store some clothes

205
00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.120
for The Following season but I try not

206
00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.199
to keep too much create a home for those

207
00:07:49.199 --> 00:07:51.319
kind of items and don't explode out of

208
00:07:51.319 --> 00:07:53.639
them know that this is all you are able

209
00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:56.280
to keep if it fits in that spot as far

210
00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.840
as keepsakes I have for Ken I have one

211
00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.280
small container that I keep for

212
00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:03.080
everything from0 to 4 years old and then

213
00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.280
now I have something that I keep for all

214
00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.759
of her school years it's in a kind of

215
00:08:07.759 --> 00:08:09.639
binder that I actually think I just got

216
00:08:09.639 --> 00:08:11.479
from Michael's the next room next to my

217
00:08:11.479 --> 00:08:14.720
daughter's is our room and like I said

218
00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.400
with my daughter's room as well I like

219
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.560
to keep things very simple when it's a

220
00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:21.199
place that you sleep the simpler it is

221
00:08:21.199 --> 00:08:23.479
the easier it is for me to fall asleep

222
00:08:23.479 --> 00:08:25.599
to stay asleep and if I do happen to

223
00:08:25.599 --> 00:08:28.159
wake up to go back to sleep very easily

224
00:08:28.159 --> 00:08:30.639
when I had a lot of decor around a lot

225
00:08:30.639 --> 00:08:32.800
of knickknacks around a lot of pictures

226
00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:35.640
around and TVs I had a really hard time

227
00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.399
falling asleep quickly or being easily

228
00:08:38.399 --> 00:08:40.279
distracted by those things that I saw so

229
00:08:40.279 --> 00:08:41.680
if you are like me and you're having a

230
00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:44.399
hard time falling asleep staying asleep

231
00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:46.240
then simplifying your room as much as

232
00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.800
possible it's going to help you to fall

233
00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.040
asleep a lot easier as you can see I

234
00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.360
actually don't have any Decor up at all

235
00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.920
besides this one beautiful mirror that

236
00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.839
my husband actually built the casing on

237
00:08:57.839 --> 00:09:00.079
the outside besides that I like to just

238
00:09:00.079 --> 00:09:02.800
have a plant and keep it very simple I

239
00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.320
don't want to have to be thinking about

240
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:07.000
what I need to clean in the morning

241
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.399
while I'm trying to sleep in our closet

242
00:09:09.399 --> 00:09:12.519
we've redone this Closet in particular I

243
00:09:12.519 --> 00:09:14.920
used to just have one long bar for

244
00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:17.000
everything in the middle and I just

245
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.760
found that it wasn't functioning the way

246
00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.760
that we needed to and so what we did is

247
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.720
we just got a big piece of wood my

248
00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:25.200
husband cut it down we got more brackets

249
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.640
from Amazon and they've done an amazing

250
00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:29.480
job just having some extra shelves

251
00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:31.640
didn't want to have to have a dresser

252
00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.839
anymore because this is a smaller size

253
00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:36.720
room not tiny but smaller and the

254
00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.200
dresser we had just took up so much

255
00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.480
space and I found that I was always

256
00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.399
having to dust it then you can see on

257
00:09:41.399 --> 00:09:43.839
either side we actually have two bars

258
00:09:43.839 --> 00:09:45.680
each which is actually more storage than

259
00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.640
we even need and another thing that I

260
00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:50.240
definitely suggest that we do as well in

261
00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.200
our closet is to have all matching

262
00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.760
hangers I just find that no it isn't

263
00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.000
necessary but I do feel like having all

264
00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.160
of the same hangers does make the closet

265
00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.000
look look instantly more appealing then

266
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.040
finally in the last room in our house we

267
00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:08.680
have this playroom SL office area that

268
00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:11.640
my daughter often does her crafts in and

269
00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:14.240
while it is extremely simple I feel like

270
00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:15.880
there is definitely a beauty to this

271
00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:18.240
room it's amazing to me that while I

272
00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.240
used to think Simplicity of Decor was a

273
00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:23.680
turn off now that I find the Simplicity

274
00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.560
to be so

275
00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.040
refreshing in the closet I have created

276
00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.959
some storage just from what we happen to

277
00:10:30.959 --> 00:10:33.160
have around the house and that's where

278
00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.320
now we have labeled her toys and some of

279
00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.920
our extra coats in that closet because

280
00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:39.880
it is Spring right now where I live and

281
00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.519
so I didn't want to have the coat

282
00:10:41.519 --> 00:10:43.839
clutter

283
00:10:43.839 --> 00:10:46.200
