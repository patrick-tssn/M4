       " \"Mark here from talkingbass.net this lesson I'll be covering one of the most basic parts of Music Theory and bass plane \",\n",
       " 'the topic of intervals and the major scale ',\n",
       " 'so what are intervals ',\n",
       " 'well ',\n",
       " 'an interval is a measurement or unit of musical distance just as meters centimeters miles feet yards and inches are all measures of physical distance ',\n",
       " 'the smallest unit we use in general western music is the semitone ',\n",
       " \"and that's really easy to see on a bass guitar neck because it's just one Frets worth of distance \",\n",
       " \"so if we're on a c third fret on the a string and we move up one fret to a c Shar that's one semitone of distance \",\n",
       " 'so C to C Shar is a semitone ',\n",
       " \"if we want to move up a tone that's two semitones of distance that'll be two Frets of distance \",\n",
       " \"so C to D that's a turn we can move up and down these two two \",\n",
       " \"so C down to b a fret that's a semi- tone \",\n",
       " 'C down to B flat ',\n",
       " \"that's a tone \",\n",
       " \"and it doesn't matter where you play these or what \",\n",
       " 'note the principle still applies ',\n",
       " 'so D to a d Shar is a semit tone ',\n",
       " 'D to e is a tone ',\n",
       " 'G Shar to a is a semitone ',\n",
       " 'G Shar to a Shar is a tone ',\n",
       " 'and so on ',\n",
       " 'now turns and semi- turns are great for describing and measuring small units of distance ',\n",
       " \"but to describe something much larger like let's say a g up to a high V flat uh would become much much more difficult in terms of tones and semmit tones we'd be looking at 20 or more semmit tones of distance \",\n",
       " \"and it's much harder to measure and keep track of uh you wouldn't use centimeters or inches to measure a large physical distance you'd be more likely to use miles or kilometers \",\n",
       " 'so we need another set of terms to describe these larger musical distances ',\n",
       " \"and that's where the major scale comes in \",\n",
       " 'major scales are built up from a formula of tones and semmit tones uh ',\n",
       " 'and that formula is uh tone tone semmit tone tone tone tone semmit tone ',\n",
       " 'so two tones and a semmit tone ',\n",
       " \"and then three tones and a semmit tone uh that might sound a little confusing but it'll make more sense when you see it on the neck \",\n",
       " 'so if we take a c at the third fret on the a string and then move up a tone to the D then up a tone to the E then up a semitone to the F ',\n",
       " \"that's the first part turnone turnone semi tone \",\n",
       " \"then we continue up to the G upper tone up another tone to the a up another tone to the B and then finally up a semitone to the C that's the whole formula tone tone semmit tone tone tone tone semit tone \",\n",
       " 'so that gives us all these notes ',\n",
       " 'c d e f g a b c ',\n",
       " \"and that's the c major scale \",\n",
       " \"now it's all well and good \",\n",
       " 'no in the scale on one string ',\n",
       " 'but to be of more use to us we really need to learn these notes across the strings ',\n",
       " 'so if we start on the C third fret on the a string with the second finger and work across we end it with the c ',\n",
       " 'then D fifth fret on the a string with the fourth finger e second fret on the D string with the first finger ',\n",
       " 'F third fret on the D string with the second finger ',\n",
       " 'G fifth fret on the D string with the fourth finger ',\n",
       " 'a second fret on the G string with the first finger ',\n",
       " 'B fourth fret on the G string with the third finger ',\n",
       " 'and finally C fifth fret on the G string with the pattern you want to learn it both up and down uh and make sure you memorize the pattern really well ',\n",
       " 'because uh this is going to be used over and over and over playing ',\n",
       " 'okay ',\n",
       " \"now the good thing about a bass or a guitar or any threed instrument is that these fingering patterns that we're learning are actually movable now \",\n",
       " 'this is a bit of a shortcut and other instrumentalists might find this a little bit of a cheat ',\n",
       " \"uh in that you don't have to learn the individual notes for a particular scale on a piano \",\n",
       " \"for instance you'd have to learn each scale by its palet of pitch names and its combination of white and black keys or accidentals \",\n",
       " 'uh ',\n",
       " \"so you'd have to know that there \",\n",
       " \"for instance there's an F in a g major scale \",\n",
       " 'Etc ',\n",
       " 'on a guitar or a Bas ',\n",
       " \"you don't really need to do that \",\n",
       " \"of course you're going to need to learn all that stuff eventually \",\n",
       " 'anyway uh ',\n",
       " 'but to begin with uh you can just just to help with the learning process ',\n",
       " \"uh it's worth learning these patterns \",\n",
       " \"so if we look at the fingering pattern that we've used for this major scale and have a look at how we've assigned a certain finger for each fret we'll find that the first finger is taking the second fret \",\n",
       " 'second finger is taking the third fret ',\n",
       " 'third finger is taking the fourth fret and the fourth finger is taking the fifth fret on each string ',\n",
       " 'now if we take that fingering pattern and we just move it up a turn so that the second finger is now on the d uh and then we move that exact same fingering pattern that we used for the c major of second finger ',\n",
       " 'fourth finger first finger ',\n",
       " 'second finger ',\n",
       " 'fourth finger ',\n",
       " 'first finger ',\n",
       " 'third finger ',\n",
       " 'fourth finger ',\n",
       " \"that's the D major scale \",\n",
       " 'you can move it wherever you want to uh to start ',\n",
       " \"so let's start on a g \",\n",
       " \"that's the G \",\n",
       " 'Major scale ',\n",
       " 'an a ',\n",
       " \"it's the a major scale \",\n",
       " 'C Shar C major scale ',\n",
       " 'gsh t- major scale ',\n",
       " 'wherever you want to play it ',\n",
       " \"that pattern and combination of tones and semi- tones is a major scale so practice that around the neck starting on different notes and then you'll be ready to move on to the intervals that are within the major scale \",\n",
       " 'so to learn these intervals first we need to number the notes of the major scale ',\n",
       " \"so if we use the same C major scale as an example and we number the notes we get the following first second third fourth fifth 6th 7eventh and we're back to the octave and can repeat the pattern again \",\n",
       " 'these numbers are actually referred to as scale degrees so we can use them to describe Melodies and baselines with reference to which notes of the scale or key are being used ',\n",
       " 'so if we go through them again C is the first degree of the c major scale uh ',\n",
       " \"it's also called the tonic or root note because it's the home and starting note that we use to label the scale D \",\n",
       " 'the second degree e ',\n",
       " 'the third f is the fourth degree ',\n",
       " 'G is the fifth degree a is the 6th degree ',\n",
       " 'B is the 7th degree and C is back to the tonic ',\n",
       " 'so you can see that the major scale is actually classed as a seven note scale ',\n",
       " 'even though when we play up and down there seem to be eight notes because we include the octave when we get to the top ',\n",
       " 'so these scale degrees are the basic for naming and describing musical intervals ',\n",
       " \"and there's a difference between scale degrees and intervals and that'll become more apparent once we've covered the actual interval names but for now just go with it \",\n",
       " 'so the intervals within a major scale use the same numbering system but we add an extra name to them uh and that can be more simply described as the first ',\n",
       " 'the fourth and the fifth are all perfect and all the other are major in a major scale ',\n",
       " \"so the first is actually referred to as the Unison which sounds a little bit weird as we're only playing one note at a time uh \",\n",
       " 'but that just comes from the fact that the study of Harmony uh generally deals with polyphonic music ',\n",
       " 'so if we play the major scale again with all the interval names we end up with the following perfect Unison ',\n",
       " 'major 2 major 3D perfect fourth perfect fifth ',\n",
       " 'major 6th ',\n",
       " 'major 7th and the perfect octave ',\n",
       " 'now we know the intervals within the major scale scale ',\n",
       " 'we can start to look at them away from a specific scale or key and more as a measuring stick for any distance anywhere on the neck at any time ',\n",
       " 'now ',\n",
       " 'to do this we need to learn them all as separate individual patterns ',\n",
       " \"and when you do this you'll start seeing how everything that we play on bass is made up of combinations of these patterns \",\n",
       " \"uh this approach to viewing all the music that you play will have a profound effect on the speed at which you learn and it'll form the basis for pretty much everything that you'll learn from B basic baselines to Advanced music theory \",\n",
       " \"and I really can't overstate the usefulness and importance of knowing and recognizing these intervals all the time \",\n",
       " 'so a straightforward exercise that we can use to go about memorizing these intervals is to ',\n",
       " 'Simply take a certain interval and just play it on every fret from a c up to the 12th fret and back again ',\n",
       " \"so let's take the major third as an example \",\n",
       " \"if we play a major third pattern on the C the third uh fret on the a string we have the C and then we've got the E on the second fret on the D string and you'll be able to see that this pattern's like a little diagonal pattern that moves uper upper string and down a fret \",\n",
       " \"and if we take time to the 12th down that's the exercise and we can apply that to all the other intervals \",\n",
       " \"so if we take fourth perfect fifth major 7th Etc as you do this the individual look of each interval will start to stand out a little more and you'll begin to get used to how they're both different and similar to each other \",\n",
       " 'uh for instance the major 3D looks a little bit like a major sixth because they both drop down a fret just on different strings uh the perfect fifth and the octave are similar in that exact same way ',\n",
       " 'same fret ',\n",
       " 'different string ',\n",
       " \"the major sth that stands out because it's a little bit different to all the others uh in just moving up a fret \",\n",
       " \"the perfect fourth that's got its own look of a barring across the two strings and each interval needs to be seen to have its own characteristic look and sound \",\n",
       " \"you want to listen to the sound of each interval uh and I'll be covering this oral recognition of the intervals in another lesson \",\n",
       " 'but for now just try to accept the sounds you hear from each interval and uh try to hear them before you play them ',\n",
       " 'uh the major second sounds like the start of a major scale uh because it is uh the perfect fifth is used in thousands of baselines ',\n",
       " \"and that's probably the most useful interval that you'll that you'll learn aside from the octave and the Unison \",\n",
       " \"and but for now you just need to concentrate on getting these interval patterns under your fingers uh and don't worry about doing too much too soon \",\n",
       " \"uh just try to recognize that there's a difference to the sound of each of the intervals as you start playing them and just pay attention to it \",\n",
       " 'now if we get back to the measuring side of intervals as we did with semitones and tones at the beginning of the lesson uh we can start to see how these new interval labels can help in describing larger uh distances ',\n",
       " \"so if we take a g on the E string the third fret and we want to measure a perfect fifth from it we just use the perfect fifth interval that we've learned and we can see that a perfect fifth from G is D \",\n",
       " 'so D is a perfect fifth from G ',\n",
       " 'okay ',\n",
       " \"and now if we take a d on the a string and we see some pattern involving a c Shar above it we now know from the intervals that we've learned that that's a major 7th patter and that c Shar is a major 7th from D \",\n",
       " 'okay ',\n",
       " \"as you learn these interval patterns by heart you should start to see these patterns automatically and it shouldn't be a process of figuring them out at all \",\n",
       " \"uh all the Melodies and Bas lines that you'll play will start to appear to you as combinations of these intervals which in turn could be really helpful in learning and memorizing things \",\n",
       " \"it's much easier to learn something when you know that it's just a succession of building blocks that you've already learned uh as opposed to a long string of unrelated notes uh that can turn into a memory feet just like learning pi to 200 decimal places \",\n",
       " 'Now One Last Thing ',\n",
       " 'Before I finish uh this first discussion on intervals ',\n",
       " \"and that's the difference between a melodic and a harmonic interval \",\n",
       " 'uh this is a really simple concept ',\n",
       " \"so don't worry \",\n",
       " \"A melodic interval is an interval played one note at a time just as we've been doing throughout the lesson \",\n",
       " 'so a harmonic interval is an interval where both notes are played at the same same time like a chord ',\n",
       " 'when you think of a harmonic it cones up images of you know harmonics or overtones of a string ',\n",
       " \"that's not what this means \",\n",
       " \"it's simply the two notes of an interval played together in harmony \",\n",
       " \"so if we take G to a d there perfect fifth played together it's a harmonic interval played separately \",\n",
       " \"it's a melodic interval \",\n",
       " 'okay ',\n",
       " \"so that's the intervals within the major scale \",\n",
       " 'uh stay tuned for my next video ',\n",
       " 'Lesson ',\n",
       " \"when I'll be covering all the other intervals uh we use in music that's the minor intervals the augmented uh and diminished intervals \",\n",
       " \"uh and I'll be clearing up a few Theory terms that might confuse you that relate to this discussion of intervals \",\n",
